# BetterIDA

Version: 1.0

## About

This is a plugin for IDA that makes it better to use.

I strongly recommend using IDA 7.7 and Python 3.10, as other versions have not been tested.

## Install

Copy `BetterIDA.py` to `%IDA_ROOT%/plugins`.

## Features

All features are enabled by default when BetterIDA is loaded. You can check and disable any of them below.

### Indent Rainbow

- Shortcut: Shift+Alt+R

- Colorize the leading spaces of each line in the pseudocode window, alternating between four different colors at each indent depth. This may be helpful in making decompiled C code more readable.
